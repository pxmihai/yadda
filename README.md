It was a fun project, because i got to play with some language tools that process 
language (NLTK) while also making it available online using an API service that 
the site connects to(kong, ex mashape) and exchanges data. All this using an MVC 
environment that works on the SPRING framework on an apache server, packaged as 
a WAR(Web Application Resource) running on a cloud application platform (heroku) 
and deployed with the Heroku Maven Plugin.
